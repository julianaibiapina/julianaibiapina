### Hi, I'm Juliana ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm a woman from the northeastern part of Brazil and passionate about technology since my teenage. Nowadays, I'm working as software developer. I deal with building web systems, APIs and systems integration, mainly using back-end technologies.

I like to work in teams with well-defined goals and know how to solve problems. I love the career I have chosen, because I can see how the technology is a path that could bring social and financial development in the context which it's inserted.
